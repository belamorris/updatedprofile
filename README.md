Look Alike - Find Your Doppelganger - Photo Comparison Matching Application

The Task
The task was to implement Node JS, Express JS, and a MySQL database using an ORM within a MVC paradigm to create an application employing servers to run the app as a website.

Site Overview
This single page style site presents the user with concise instructions and an intuitive interface. The user is asked to enter their name and an image URL. After this information is entered, they simply hit the button titled "Doppelganger Me" and the user's photo is compared against a set of stored photos to find that which has the highest confidence match. As the search commences, the user is shown the image, name, and confidence match of each comparison run. Once the comparison matching process is complete, an alert appears indicating that a best match was found. When the user clicks on the "Ok" button in the alert, their best match appears along with the confidence level of the match, presented as Best Match %. The bottom, left-hand side of the screen shows a count indicator that provides information regarding how many clients are currently on the site. User information input into the site is saved in the database.
